# Labels

On GitHub our issues and pull requests are marked with labels.  The most common ones are explained below.

## Labels for pull requests

- `Dependant On Release` - this label is for documentation pull requests that are made in advance of a new Umbraco release, will be merged in once the changes have been released
- `need-OUR-update` - this label is used for PR's awaiting some new functionality being added to the Our Umbraco website
- `D-Team` - this label is usually used when the PR is about something with Umbraco Core that the documentation team is not familiar with, meaning it requires a review from the Umbraco development team
- `Umbraco Cloud`, `Umbraco Forms`, etc - if the issue is specific to something other than Umbraco CMS it will get the relevant Umbraco product label

## Issue labels

The issue repository has several labels, these are not something you can add yourself but they may be added to your issue and other issues. Here is a quick overview of the commonly used labels and what they mean:

- `discuss` - this label is added to issues that are not a tangible problem or very large, an issue with the discuss label is something everyone is encouraged to give their opinion on!
- `missing documentation` - for issues about missing information, if you see this and wish to make a pull request on it please write that in a comment
- `incorrect documentation` - for documentation that is wrong, this can be due to many things, often it is outdated
- `up-for-grabs` - any issue with an up-for-grabs label is something no-one is actively working on and is open for anyone wishing to contribute
- `Dependant On Release` - this label is for documentation pull requests that are made in advance of a new Umbraco release, will be merged in once the changes have been released
- `need-OUR-update` - this label is used for PR's awaiting some new functionality being added to the Our Umbraco website
- `Umbraco Cloud`, `Umbraco Forms`, etc - if the issue is specific to something other than Umbraco CMS it will get the relevant Umbraco product label
